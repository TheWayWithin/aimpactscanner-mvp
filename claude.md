- **Impact**: Tool now provides legitimate framework-compliant analysis instead of random scores

#### Evidence-Based Scoring Algorithms (NEW - July 27, 2025)
- **Innovation**: Replaced binary 0/100 scoring with nuanced 30-95% ranges per factor
- **Technical Details**: Each factor has unique algorithm (word count, keyword presence, structure analysis)
- **Example**: Title Optimization checks length (30-60 chars), keyword presence, brand placement
- **Scoring Philosophy**: No perfect scores (95% max) reflecting real-world optimization reality
- **User Value**: Actionable insights showing specific improvement areas instead of pass/fail

#### Location Reference Bug Fix (NEW - July 27, 2025)
- **Problem**: Edge Function error "location is not defined" in Deno environment
- **Root Cause**: Browser-specific `location` object used in Evidence Chunking function
- **Solution**: Removed browser dependency, used simple string matching for internal links
- **Learning**: Edge Functions run in Deno, not browser - avoid browser-specific APIs

- âœ… Updated schema_v3_1_1_validation.py with reconciled factor counts and weights
- âœ… Main framework document v3.1.1 with complete 148-factor specifications

### Success Criteria for Framework Compliance (ALL ACHIEVED âœ…)
- âœ… All 10 factors map to official framework specifications with correct IDs
- âœ… Factor weighting reflects actual framework importance (20/80 principle)
- âœ… Overall scores are evidence-based and actionable (not random)
- âœ… Results Dashboard displays correct official pillar weights
- âœ… Analysis provides framework-compliant recommendations
- âœ… Live testing validated: example.com (29/100), anthropic.com (67/100)

### Framework Compliance Prompts

#### Implement Framework-Compliant Factors
```
Replace current random factor implementation with official framework factors:
1. Use the 10 high-impact factors identified in Framework Compliance Plan
2. Map factor IDs correctly (AI.1.1, AI.1.2, A.3.1, A.3.2, M.1.4, M.2.1, M.2.2, S.2.2, E.1.1)
3. Implement evidence-based analysis algorithms for each factor
4. Apply proper weighting based on official framework pillar weights
5. Provide actionable recommendations aligned with framework specifications
```

#### Schema-Driven Development
```
Integrate framework schema for dynamic factor configuration:
1. Use docs/schema_v3_1_1_validation.py for official framework specifications
2. Implement factor relevance flags and version tracking
3. Support multiple framework versions for backward compatibility
4. Enable competitive analysis based on framework benchmarks
```

#### Framework Performance Validation
```
Validate framework compliance implementation:
1. Verify all factor IDs match official framework specifications
2. Confirm pillar weights use official values (AI: 23.8%, A: 17.9%, M: 14.6%, etc.)
3. Test evidence-based scoring provides realistic 30-95% ranges
4. Validate Results Dashboard displays correct framework structure
5. Ensure recommendations align with official framework guidance
