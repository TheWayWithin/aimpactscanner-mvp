### 🚨 CRITICAL TECHNICAL ISSUE: DATABASE CONNECTIVITY TIMEOUT
- **Problem**: All Supabase database queries timeout after 10 seconds
- **Impact**: Database-dependent features (user tracking, progress storage, history) non-functional
- **Workaround**: Simplified components providing complete user experience without database
- **Status**: Working around issue with client-side solutions
- **Investigation Needed**: Root cause of database timeouts (RLS policies, network, service issue)

### Critical Lessons Learned

#### Database Schema Issues (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: Missing columns (`message`, `stage`, `progress_percent`, `phase`)
- **Solution**: Always check table schema before Edge Function deployment
- **Command**: Use `SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'table_name'`

#### RLS Policy Conflicts (RESOLVED)  
- **Problem**: Service role couldn't update user tables due to auth.uid() policies
- **Solution**: Add service role policies: `current_setting('role') = 'service_role'`
- **Location**: `supabase/migrations/003_service_role_policies.sql`

#### Edge Function Timeout Constraints (MONITORED)
- **Current Status**: 10-factor analysis targets <15 seconds (within 60s limit)
- **Risk**: Medium - could approach timeout under load
- **Mitigation Plan**: 4 documented fallback options (factor reduction, async processing, progressive enhancement, platform migration)
- **Monitoring**: Performance tracking with 50s warning threshold implemented

#### Testing Framework Implementation (COMPLETE)

- **Technical Implementation**: Complete factor remapping with evidence-based scoring algorithms
- **Result**: Realistic 30-95% scoring with proper framework pillar weights (AI: 23.8%, A: 17.9%, etc.)
- **Validation**: Tested with example.com (29/100) and anthropic.com (67/100) showing accurate differentiation
- **Impact**: Tool now provides legitimate framework-compliant analysis instead of random scores

#### Evidence-Based Scoring Algorithms (NEW - July 27, 2025)
- **Innovation**: Replaced binary 0/100 scoring with nuanced 30-95% ranges per factor
- **Technical Details**: Each factor has unique algorithm (word count, keyword presence, structure analysis)
- **Example**: Title Optimization checks length (30-60 chars), keyword presence, brand placement
- **Scoring Philosophy**: No perfect scores (95% max) reflecting real-world optimization reality
- **User Value**: Actionable insights showing specific improvement areas instead of pass/fail

#### Location Reference Bug Fix (July 27, 2025)
- **Problem**: Edge Function error "location is not defined" in Deno environment
- **Root Cause**: Browser-specific `location` object used in Evidence Chunking function
- **Solution**: Removed browser dependency, used simple string matching for internal links
- **Learning**: Edge Functions run in Deno, not browser - avoid browser-specific APIs
- **Prevention**: Add Deno compatibility checks to development workflow

#### Database Connectivity Workaround Architecture (July 27, 2025)
- **Problem**: All Supabase database queries timeout after 10 seconds despite correct configuration
- **Investigation Results**: Environment variables ✅, Authentication ✅, Edge Function ✅, Database queries ❌
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - potentially RLS policies, network configuration, or Supabase service issue

## Development Environment Setup

### Database Schema Verification
```
Before any database-related development, verify schema:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = '[table_name]'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

### Edge Function Testing
```
Test Edge Function changes locally:
1. `supabase functions deploy [function-name]`
2. Check logs: Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Logs
3. Test via frontend or direct API call
4. Monitor for timeout and permission errors
```

### Real-Time Subscription Debugging
```
If real-time features aren't working:
1. Check browser console for CHANNEL_ERROR messages
2. Simplify channel configuration to basic setup:
   `supabase.channel(`analysis_progress_${analysisId}`)`
3. Remove complex broadcast/presence options that can cause failures
4. Verify RLS policies allow service role and user access
5. Test with different user accounts and network conditions
```

### VPN and Global User Testing
```
Test features with global users and VPN scenarios:
1. Test timezone display with users in different geographic locations
2. Verify functionality with common VPN services (NordVPN, ExpressVPN, etc.)
3. Use manual UTC calculations instead of browser timezone APIs
4. Validate that all time displays show consistent Eastern Time
5. Include VPN testing in regular QA processes
```

### RLS Policy Troubleshooting
```
If Edge Function can't update tables, check RLS policies:
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = '[table_name]';
```
Ensure service role policies exist for INSERT/UPDATE operations.

## ✅ FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (July 27, 2025)

### Critical Framework Analysis Findings (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: Current 10 factors don't map to official MASTERY-AI Framework v3.1.1
- **Example**: Our "HTTPS Security" → AI.1.1 but framework AI.1.1 is "Citation-Worthy Content Structure"
- **Impact**: Random scoring instead of evidence-based framework compliance
- **Solution**: Complete factor remapping using updated corrected framework documents

### High-Impact Factor Selection (20/80 Principle)
Based on official framework weights and technical feasibility:

**AI Pillar (23.8% - HIGHEST IMPACT):**
- AI.1.1: Citation-Worthy Content Structure ✅ Easy to assess
- AI.1.2: Source Authority Signals ✅ Easy to assess
- AI.1.5: Evidence Chunking for RAG Optimization ✅ Easy to assess

**A Pillar (17.9% - SECOND HIGHEST):**
- A.3.1: Transparency & Disclosure Standards ✅ Easy to assess
- A.3.2: Contact Information & Accessibility ✅ Easy to assess

**M Pillar (14.6% - ENHANCED WITH LLMs.txt):**
- M.1.4: Security and Access Control (HTTPS) ✅ Easy to assess
- M.2.1: Title Tag Optimization ✅ Easy to assess
- M.2.2: Meta Description Quality ✅ Easy to assess

**S & E Pillars:**
- S.2.2: Heading Structure & Hierarchy ✅ Easy to assess
- E.1.1: Page Load Speed Optimization ✅ Easy to assess

### Framework Compliance Implementation

#### Phase 1: Immediate Factor Remapping
```
Update Edge Function with official framework factors:
1. Replace current random factors with 10 framework-mapped factors
2. Implement proper factor weighting using official pillar weights (AI: 23.8%, A: 17.9%, etc.)
3. Update Results Dashboard to use schema-driven weights instead of hardcoded values
4. Fix factor analysis algorithms to provide evidence-based scoring (30-95% ranges)
```

#### Phase 2: Schema Integration
```
Integrate with official framework schema:
1. Use docs/schema_v3_1_1_validation.py for dynamic factor configuration
2. Implement factor relevance flags (LLMs.txt, MCP integration capabilities)
3. Add framework version tracking for backward compatibility
4. Support competitive analysis based on framework specifications
```

#### Phase 3: Advanced Framework Features
```
Implement cutting-edge framework capabilities:
1. MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration assessment
2. LLMs.txt content accessibility evaluation
3. Content integrity and synthetic content validation
4. Cross-agent compatibility scoring
```

### Framework Document Updates Used
- ✅ Updated Pillar AI document with corrected sub-pillar weights (100.0% validated)
- ✅ Updated Pillar A document with corrected sub-pillar weights (100.0% validated)
- ✅ Updated schema_v3_1_1_validation.py with reconciled factor counts and weights
- ✅ Main framework document v3.1.1 with complete 148-factor specifications

### Success Criteria for Framework Compliance (ALL ACHIEVED ✅)
- ✅ All 10 factors map to official framework specifications with correct IDs
- ✅ Factor weighting reflects actual framework importance (20/80 principle)
- ✅ Overall scores are evidence-based and actionable (not random)
- ✅ Results Dashboard displays correct official pillar weights
- ✅ Analysis provides framework-compliant recommendations
- ✅ Live testing validated: example.com (29/100), anthropic.com (67/100)

### Framework Compliance Prompts

#### Implement Framework-Compliant Factors
```
Replace current random factor implementation with official framework factors:
1. Use the 10 high-impact factors identified in Framework Compliance Plan
2. Map factor IDs correctly (AI.1.1, AI.1.2, A.3.1, A.3.2, M.1.4, M.2.1, M.2.2, S.2.2, E.1.1)
3. Implement evidence-based analysis algorithms for each factor
4. Apply proper weighting based on official framework pillar weights
5. Provide actionable recommendations aligned with framework specifications
```

#### Schema-Driven Development
```
Integrate framework schema for dynamic factor configuration:
1. Use docs/schema_v3_1_1_validation.py for official framework specifications
2. Implement factor relevance flags and version tracking
3. Support multiple framework versions for backward compatibility
4. Enable competitive analysis based on framework benchmarks
```

#### Framework Performance Validation
```
Validate framework compliance implementation:
1. Verify all factor IDs match official framework specifications
2. Confirm pillar weights use official values (AI: 23.8%, A: 17.9%, M: 14.6%, etc.)
3. Test evidence-based scoring provides realistic 30-95% ranges
4. Validate Results Dashboard displays correct framework structure
5. Ensure recommendations align with official framework guidance
