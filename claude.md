# AImpactScanner Claude Code Prompts
## Updated July 24, 2025 - Complete MVP Ready for Production Deployment

## Current Project State

### ðŸš€ PRODUCTION-READY COMPLETE MVP âœ…
- **10-Factor Analysis System**: Full implementation with sophisticated scoring (30-95% ranges)
- **Complete Payment Integration**: Coffee Tier ($5/month) with Stripe + webhook processing
- **Full User Experience**: Tier management, account dashboard, upgrade flow integrated
- **Real-Time Progress**: Live analysis updates with educational content
- **Backend Deployed**: All Supabase Edge Functions live and operational
- **Frontend Ready**: React app with all features complete and tested
- **Single Blocker**: Netlify deployment configuration (backend fully functional)

### Critical Lessons Learned

#### Database Schema Issues (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: Missing columns (`message`, `stage`, `progress_percent`, `phase`)
- **Solution**: Always check table schema before Edge Function deployment
- **Command**: Use `SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'table_name'`

#### RLS Policy Conflicts (RESOLVED)  
- **Problem**: Service role couldn't update user tables due to auth.uid() policies
- **Solution**: Add service role policies: `current_setting('role') = 'service_role'`
- **Location**: `supabase/migrations/003_service_role_policies.sql`

#### Edge Function Timeout Constraints (MONITORED)
- **Current Status**: 10-factor analysis targets <15 seconds (within 60s limit)
- **Risk**: Medium - could approach timeout under load
- **Mitigation Plan**: 4 documented fallback options (factor reduction, async processing, progressive enhancement, platform migration)
- **Monitoring**: Performance tracking with 50s warning threshold implemented

#### Testing Framework Implementation (COMPLETE)
- **Achievement**: Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, E2E, and performance tests
- **Coverage**: Factor validation, database operations, real-time progress, concurrent users
- **Environment**: Proper UUID handling, test data management, cleanup automation
- **Commands**: Easy-to-use npm scripts for different test scenarios

#### Real Factor Implementation Success (NEW - July 19, 2025)
- **Achievement**: Transformed from binary 0/100% to nuanced 30-95% scoring
- **Lesson**: User feedback drives critical improvements - binary scoring was identified as major limitation
- **Solution**: Implemented sophisticated content analysis with realistic score distribution
- **Impact**: Tool now provides actionable insights instead of pass/fail results

#### Database Schema Validation (NEW)
- **Problem**: Live database schema differed from migration files
- **Lesson**: Always validate schema against live database, not just migration files
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling and fallback values
- **Prevention**: Include schema validation in deployment checklist

#### Production Deployment Strategy (NEW - July 24, 2025)
- **Decision**: Deploy complete 10-factor MVP with all features
- **Rationale**: All features work in development - issue is deployment config, not code
- **Architecture**: Backend 100% functional on Supabase, frontend deployment is only blocker
- **Risk Management**: 4 documented Edge Function timeout mitigation strategies
- **Handover**: Complete deployment plan documented for session continuity

## Testing Framework

### Test Environment Setup âœ…
The project now includes a complete testing framework supporting test-driven development:

```bash
# Quick setup and validation
npm run test:setup     # Initialize test environment
npm run test:summary   # Get current status overview

# Development workflow
npm run test:unit -- --watch  # TDD for factor implementation
npm run test:db        # Database operations validation
npm run test:progress  # Real-time progress tracking
npm run test:coverage  # Coverage analysis
npm run test:ui        # Visual test dashboard
```

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests (`npm run test:unit`)
- **Purpose**: Individual factor validation

# 4. Performance validation
npm run test:performance
```

#### Database Testing
```bash
# Validate database operations
npm run test:db

# Test real-time progress
npm run test:progress

# Edge Function integration
npm run test:edge
```

## Enhanced Development Prompts

### Two-Phase Analysis Development
```
Implement enhanced factor analysis following our two-phase architecture:
- Phase A (Instant): 10 factors in <15 seconds using existing simplified Edge Function
- Phase B (Background): 12 factors via queue system for complete 22-factor analysis
Refer to Factor Implementation Guide v1.0 for exact specifications and code examples.
```

### Factor Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT PRIORITY (July 24, 2025)

### CRITICAL: Fix Netlify Frontend Deployment
```
**Current Blocker**: Netlify build failing despite complete backend functionality
**Fix Strategy**: Debug build configuration with complete 10-factor MVP
**Expected Resolution**: 1-2 hours
**Impact**: Immediate revenue generation capability once resolved
```

### Post-Deployment Tasks (After Live Site)
```
1. Switch to Production Stripe Keys (15 minutes)
2. Test Complete User Journey (15 minutes)  
3. Monitor Edge Function Performance (ongoing)
4. Implement timeout mitigation if needed (30 minutes)
```

### Edge Function Timeout Mitigation Options
```
If 10-factor analysis approaches 60s timeout:
**Option A**: Reduce to 5 core factors (5 minutes)
**Option B**: Implement async background processing (15 minutes)
**Option C**: Progressive enhancement (30 minutes)
**Option D**: Migrate to Netlify Functions (2-4 hours)
```

### Future Enhancement Roadmap (Post-Revenue)
```
- Additional factor implementation (extend beyond 10)
- Queue-based processing for complex analysis
- Advanced caching and performance optimization
- Multi-region deployment
```

---

## Development Environment Setup

### Database Schema Verification
```
Before any database-related development, verify schema:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = '[table_name]'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

### Edge Function Testing
```
Test Edge Function changes locally:
1. `supabase functions deploy [function-name]`
2. Check logs: Supabase Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions â†’ Logs
3. Test via frontend or direct API call
4. Monitor for timeout and permission errors
```

### RLS Policy Troubleshooting
```
If Edge Function can't update tables, check RLS policies:
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = '[table_name]';
```
Ensure service role policies exist for INSERT/UPDATE operations.
