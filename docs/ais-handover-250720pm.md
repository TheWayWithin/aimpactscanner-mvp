## 🛠 Technical Architecture: Enhanced Factor Analysis

### **Core Improvements**

#### **HTML Content Preservation**
```typescript
// Previous: Stripped all HTML before analysis
const content = html.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, ' ').replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim();

// Enhanced: Preserve HTML for structured analysis, selective cleaning
const content = html; // Keep full HTML for structured data detection
// Individual functions clean content as needed
```

#### **Sophisticated Detection Patterns**
```typescript
// Meta Description: Multiple pattern support
- Standard: <meta name="description" content="...">
- Reversed: <meta content="..." name="description">
- OpenGraph: <meta property="og:description" content="...">
- Twitter: <meta name="twitter:description" content="...">

// Structured Data: Recursive extraction
const extractSchemas = (obj) => {
  // Handles @graph, nested objects, arrays
  // Finds schemas at any depth in JSON-LD
};
```

#### **Enhanced Scoring Logic**
```typescript
// Title Optimization: Balanced scoring
- Base descriptive content: +25 points
- Brand recognition: +15 points  
- Domain keywords: +15 points
- Engagement elements: bonus only

// FAQ Analysis: Contextual scoring
- Schema detection: +50 points
- Multiple schemas: +20 points (4+), +10 points (2-3)
- Quality content: +10 points (detailed answers)
```

### **Quality Assurance Patterns**

#### **Evidence Enhancement**
- Specific findings with counts and details
- Educational context about importance
- Quality indicators and implementation recognition

#### **Recommendation Intelligence**
- Context-aware suggestions based on content type
- Progressive improvement paths
- Domain-specific guidance

#### **Confidence Scoring**
- Higher confidence for definitive findings
- Lower confidence for estimated/contextual analysis
- Transparent uncertainty communication
