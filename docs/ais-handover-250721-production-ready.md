## 🏗️ Architecture Flexibility Assessment

### **✅ What Works for MVP (Deploy Now)**
1. **Database Structure**: Supports tier changes via `tier` column
2. **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration handles multiple price points
3. **TierManager Class**: Centralizes access control logic
4. **Real-time Features**: Supabase subscriptions for progress tracking

### **⚠️ Current Limitations (V2/V3 Features)**
1. **Hardcoded Limits**: Analysis limits in 3 locations:
   - SQL function: `monthly_used >= 3` (line 121)
   - TierSelection.jsx: `analyses: '3 per month'`
   - UsageDashboard.jsx: `Math.max(0, 3 - usage.monthly_analyses_used)`

2. **Static Feature Lists**: No admin interface for tier management
3. **Code-Based Changes**: Limit adjustments require deployment

### **V2 Enhancement Strategy (Post-MVP)**
```sql
-- Dynamic tier configuration table
CREATE TABLE tier_configurations (
    tier_name VARCHAR(20),
    analysis_limit INTEGER, -- -1 for unlimited
    features JSONB,
    price_monthly DECIMAL,
    active BOOLEAN
);
```

**Benefits**: Admin can modify tiers without code deployment, A/B testing capabilities

## 🚀 Backend Deployment Architecture

### **Current Infrastructure (Production Ready)**

#### **Supabase-Based Architecture**
```
Frontend (Netlify) → Supabase Edge Functions → PostgreSQL Database
                  ↕
               Stripe Webhooks (subscription management)
```

#### **Deployed Components**
- ✅ **Database**: PostgreSQL with complete Coffee tier schema
- ✅ **Edge Functions**: 3 functions deployed and tested
  - `analyze-page`: Main analysis with tier validation
  - `create-checkout-session`: Stripe payment initiation  
  - `stripe-webhook`: Subscription management
- ✅ **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with magic links
- ✅ **Real-time**: Progress tracking with educational content

#### **Deployment Commands**
```bash
# Deploy all Edge Functions
npm run deploy:functions

# Verify database migration
npm run verify:migration

# Check Coffee tier status
npm run coffee:status
```

### **Missing Infrastructure (Post-MVP)**
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Currently manual deployment
- **Staging Environment**: Direct to production deployment
- **Error Monitoring**: Basic logging only
- **Automated Backups**: Supabase default only
