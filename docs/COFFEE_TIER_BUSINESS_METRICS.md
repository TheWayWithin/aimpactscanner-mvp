SELECT 
  'Coffee Tier MRR' as metric,
  COUNT(*) * 5 as mrr_usd,
  COUNT(*) as active_subscribers,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 5 * 12, 0) as annual_run_rate

FROM subscriptions 
WHERE tier = 'coffee'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

### **Conversion Metrics**

#### **Free to Coffee Conversion Rate**

    COUNT(CASE WHEN tier = 'coffee' THEN 1 END) as coffee_users,
    COUNT(*) as total_users
  FROM users
)
SELECT 
  free_users,
  coffee_users,
  total_users,
  ROUND((coffee_users::float / total_users::float) * 100, 2) as coffee_conversion_rate,
  ROUND((coffee_users::float / (free_users + coffee_users)::float) * 100, 2) as paid_conversion_rate
FROM user_stats;
```

#### **Weekly Conversion Tracking**
```sql

    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE) as new_signups_today,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM subscriptions WHERE tier = 'coffee' AND created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE) as new_coffee_today,

    ELSE 0 
  END as daily_conversion_rate,
  coffee_analyses_today
FROM daily_stats;
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Optimization Strategies

### **Conversion Rate Optimization**

#### **A/B Testing Targets**
```bash
# Test these elements for improved conversion:
1. Pricing page copy ("Buy Me a Coffee" vs "Upgrade to Unlimited")
2. Tier limit messaging (when users hit 3 analyses)
3. Upgrade button placement and color
4. Value proposition emphasis (speed, unlimited, professional)
```

#### **Funnel Analysis**
```sql
-- Identify conversion bottlenecks
WITH funnel AS (
  SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT u.id) as total_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ua.user_id IS NOT NULL THEN u.id END) as users_who_analyzed,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN u.monthly_analyses_used >= 3 THEN u.id END) as users_hit_limit,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.user_id IS NOT NULL THEN u.id END) as users_upgraded
  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN usage_analytics ua ON u.id = ua.user_id
  LEFT JOIN subscriptions s ON u.id = s.user_id AND s.tier = 'coffee'
  WHERE u.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
SELECT 
  total_users,
  users_who_analyzed,
  users_hit_limit,
  users_upgraded,
  ROUND((users_who_analyzed::float / total_users::float) * 100, 1) as analysis_rate,
  ROUND((users_hit_limit::float / users_who_analyzed::float) * 100, 1) as limit_hit_rate,
  ROUND((users_upgraded::float / users_hit_limit::float) * 100, 1) as upgrade_rate
FROM funnel;
```

### **Revenue Optimization**

#### **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**
```sql
-- Calculate Coffee tier LTV
WITH subscription_durations AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    created_at,
    CASE 
      WHEN status = 'active' THEN EXTRACT(days FROM NOW() - created_at)
      ELSE EXTRACT(days FROM updated_at - created_at)
    END as days_subscribed
  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE tier = 'coffee'
)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_coffee_subscribers,
  ROUND(AVG(days_subscribed), 0) as avg_days_subscribed,
  ROUND(AVG(days_subscribed) / 30.0, 1) as avg_months_subscribed,
  ROUND((AVG(days_subscribed) / 30.0) * 5, 2) as estimated_ltv
FROM subscription_durations;
```

#### **Churn Analysis**
```sql
-- Monthly churn rate calculation
WITH monthly_churn AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', updated_at) as month,
    COUNT(*) as churned_users
  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE tier = 'coffee' 
  AND status IN ('canceled', 'incomplete_expired')
  GROUP BY month
),
monthly_active AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', date_val) as month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.user_id) as active_users
  FROM generate_series(
    DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months'),
    DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()),
    INTERVAL '1 month'
  ) date_val
  CROSS JOIN subscriptions s
  WHERE s.tier = 'coffee'
  AND s.created_at <= date_val
  AND (s.status = 'active' OR s.updated_at > date_val)
  GROUP BY month
)
SELECT 
  ma.month,
  ma.active_users,
  COALESCE(mc.churned_users, 0) as churned_users,
  ROUND((COALESCE(mc.churned_users, 0)::float / ma.active_users::float) * 100, 2) as churn_rate_percent
FROM monthly_active ma
LEFT JOIN monthly_churn mc ON ma.month = mc.month
ORDER BY ma.month DESC;
```
