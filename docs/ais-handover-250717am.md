**Status**: ✅ READY FOR TEST-DRIVEN FACTOR IMPLEMENTATION + E2E TESTING  
**Next Phase**: Complete Playwright setup (15 min) + Implement real factors using TDD approach  
**Timeline**: 3-5 days to complete Phase A (10 factors)  
**Success Probability**: EXTREMELY HIGH (solid foundation + comprehensive testing + E2E validation)  
**Recommended Start**: 
1. `npm run test:playwright:ui` (finish Playwright setup)
2. `npm run test:unit -- --watch` (start HTTPS factor implementation)
3. Use both unit and E2E tests for comprehensive validation
