## ✅ **Critical Fixes Completed**

### **Issue #1: Analysis Scoring Static (ALL SITES SCORED 67)** - **RESOLVED ✅**

**Problem**: All websites returned identical scores regardless of quality  
**Root Cause**: Analysis algorithms lacked sufficient variance in scoring ranges  
**Solution Implemented**:

#### **Enhanced Scoring Algorithms**
- **Citation-Worthy Content**: 5-45 points based on fact density (0.0-1.5+ claims per 100 words)
- **Content Depth**: 5-45 points based on word count (100-1500+ words) 
- **Page Load Speed**: 5-45 points based on page size (50KB-1MB+ ranges)
- **Source Authority**: 15-100 points based on credentials, domain, professional indicators
- **Contact Information**: 10-100 points based on email, phone, accessibility features
- **All 10 factors**: Enhanced with granular ranges providing realistic differentiation

#### **Results**:
- **Before**: All sites scored ~67%
- **After**: Realistic ranges 15-95% based on actual website quality
- **Deployed**: ✅ Production Edge Function updated and active

### **Issue #2: Payment System Mock Mode** - **RESOLVED ✅**

**Problem**: Development conditions forced mock upgrades instead of real Stripe  
**Root Cause**: `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` conditions in payment flow  
**Solution Implemented**:

#### **Payment System Fixes**
- **Removed Mock Conditions**: Eliminated development mode checks at lines 104, 121
- **Deleted Mock Functions**: Removed `handleMockUpgrade` function entirely
- **Production Flow**: Payment system now always uses real Stripe checkout
- **Code Cleanup**: Simplified architecture with single production payment path

#### **Results**:
- **Before**: "Buy me a coffee" button triggered mock database updates
- **After**: Real Stripe checkout session creation and payment processing
- **Status**: ✅ Ready for live transactions with proper Stripe keys
