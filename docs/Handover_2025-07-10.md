## 1. Project Overview & Strategic Context

The AImpactScanner Single-Page MVP is a sophisticated application designed for rapid market validation through AI optimization analysis, serving as a brand ambassador for **AI Search Mastery**. It embodies the brand's authority as "the creator and definitive authority on advanced AI search optimization through the proprietary MASTERY-AI Framework v2.1 Enhanced Edition".

The MVP aims to deliver a 22-factor analysis (from a 132 atomic factor methodology), real-time progress updates, educational content, interactive reporting, and a freemium business model.

**Key Brand Integration Goal:** Every aspect of development must reflect AI Search Mastery's sophisticated brand identity, visual guidelines, voice, and messaging, consistently referencing the MASTERY-AI Framework.

## 2. Development Environment Configuration

This project has been developed under **exceptionally challenging environment circumstances**. Precise details of the current stable setup and all workarounds are critical for any future re-orientation.

### 2.1 User's Local Machine Setup (Current Stable Environment)

* **Operating System:** macOS
* **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* **Project Location:** The `aimpactscanner-mvp` project folder is located in a **truly local, unsynced directory** (e.g., `~/DevProjects/`). This was a critical fix for stability.
* **Version Control:** Git managed locally, **successfully pushed and synchronized** with GitHub (`https://github.com/TheWayWithin/aimpactscanner-mvp`).
* **Runtime:** Node.js `v22.16.0`
* **Package Manager:** npm `10.9.2`
* **Package Manager (macOS):** Homebrew `4.5.8`
* **Deno Extension:** VS Code Deno extension is installed (Deno runtime is handled by Supabase Edge Functions environment).

### 2.2 Supabase Configuration

* **Supabase Project Name:** `aimpactscanner-mvp`
* **Supabase Project URL:** `https://<YOUR_PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co` (obtained from Supabase Dashboard)
* **Supabase API Keys:** `anon` (public) key used in frontend (`.env.local`), `service_role` key used as `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` secret in Edge Functions.
* **Database Schema:** Comprehensive brand-integrated schema deployed (tables: `users`, `analyses`, `analysis_progress`, `educational_content`, `usage_analytics`).
* **Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:**
    * Standard RLS policies are enabled for all tables.
    * **Crucial Policy for User Insert:** "Allow authenticated user insert" policy is **present and enabled** on the `public.users` table. This policy is vital for the frontend to `upsert` user records.
* **Authentication Settings:**
    * **Site URL:** Correctly set to `http://localhost:5173` (for local development).
    * **Additional Redirect URLs:** `http://localhost:5173/*`.
    * **"Enable email signup"**: **ON**.
    * **"Enable email confirm"**: **OFF** (this was a critical fix for user persistence).
* **Realtime Configuration:** Confirmed Realtime is enabled for `public:analysis_progress` under **Database > Publications**.
* **Edge Functions:**
    * `analyze-page` Edge Function successfully deployed and running.
    * `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set as an Edge Function Secret.

## 3. Starting a New Development Session (Crucial Steps)

To ensure a clean and functional start in any new development session (e.g., after closing VS Code, restarting machine, or if issues arise):

1.  **Verify Local Project Location:** Ensure the `aimpactscanner-mvp` folder is in a **truly local, unsynced directory** (e.g., `~/DevProjects/`).
2.  **Open Project in VS Code:** Use `File -> Open Folder...` to open the project from its local path.
3.  **Open VS Code Integrated Terminal:** `Terminal -> New Terminal`.
4.  **Clear ALL Test Data in Supabase:**
    * Go to Supabase Dashboard.
    * **Table Editor**: Delete all rows from `analysis_progress` and `analyses`. **Do NOT delete users** (unless instructed for specific user-related tests).
    * **Authentication > Users**: Only delete if a specific user test requires it.
5.  **Redeploy the Edge Function:**
    * In VS Code terminal: `supabase functions deploy analyze-page --no-verify-jwt`
    * This ensures the latest code is active on Supabase.
6.  **Start the Development Server:**
    * In VS Code terminal: `npm run dev`
    * The terminal will provide the `http://localhost:5173/` URL.
7.  **Launch CORS-Disabled Chrome (IMPORTANT WORKAROUND):**
    * Open a **separate Terminal window** (outside VS Code).
    * Run: `/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_session"`
    * **Always use this specific Chrome instance for testing the AImpactScanner application locally.**
8.  **Sign Up / Log In from Scratch (if needed):**
    * In the CORS-disabled Chrome, navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`.
    * If the login form appears, enter your email and click "Send magic link".
    * **Crucially, copy the magic link URL from your email and paste it directly into the address bar of the CORS-disabled Chrome instance.** Press Enter.
    * Verify your user appears in **Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> Users** and **Table Editor -> `public.users` table**.
9.  **Begin Testing/Development.**

## 4. Current Progress & Functional State

The core analysis pipeline is **PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL** and is currently blocked by a persistent final database update error.

### 4.1 Frontend Setup & Core Logic

* **Core Real-time Functionality:** Successfully receives and displays live updates from `analysis_progress` table when triggered by the Edge Function.
* **User Authentication & Persistence:** Magic link login/signup works, and the user record correctly persists in both Supabase Auth and `public.users` table.

### 4.2 Backend Edge Function (`analyze-page`)

* **Function Execution (Partial):** The Edge Function executes, simulates the 22-factor analysis, and sends real-time progress updates all the way to 100% in the UI.
* **Data Persistence (Partial Failure):** The Edge Function **attempts** to update the final `analyses` table record but **fails at the very end**, resulting in an error pop-up for the user. Data for most fields is not persisted, though `status` might update depending on timing.

## 5. Unresolved Issues & Workarounds (CRITICAL - Current Blockers)

All previous issues have been resolved, but **one persistent functional blocker** remains, and one cosmetic issue is parked.

### 5.1 **CURRENT FUNCTIONAL BLOCKER:** Persistent `PGRST204` Error on Final `analyses` Table Update

* **Problem:** The `analyze-page` Edge Function successfully runs its simulation to 100% in the UI, but at the very final `update` operation to the `analyses` table, it consistently throws an error. The logs show: `Edge Function Error: Error updating analyses table with final result: { code: "PGRST204", ... message: "Could not find the 'analysis_duration' column of 'analyses' in the schema cache" }`.
* **Status:** **UNRESOLVED - PRIMARY FUNCTIONAL BLOCKER.**
* **Root Cause Suspected:** A highly **stubborn schema cache desynchronization** within Supabase's PostgREST (the API layer) specific to this project. PostgREST consistently fails to recognize certain columns (specifically `analysis_duration`, but potentially others in the same update payload like `framework_version`, `framework_confidence_score`, `page_title`, `page_description`, `quick_wins`, `metadata`), despite:
    * **Confirmation:** The `analyses` table definition explicitly shows these columns exist and are `snake_case` (e.g., `analysis_duration INTEGER`).
    * **Confirmation:** Manual SQL `UPDATE` queries directly in Supabase SQL Editor *succeed* (with "no rows returned" if the record isn't there, or updating if it is).
* **Impact:** Prevents comprehensive final analysis results from being fully saved to the `analyses` table, leading to an error pop-up for the user and incomplete data.
* **Workarounds Attempted (Unsuccessful for this specific error):**
    * **Explicit Naming:** Tried passing `camelCase`, `snake_case`, and `double-quoted snake_case` for columns in `update` payload.
    * **Payload Simplification:** Incrementally added fields back to the update payload; error appears when `analysis_duration` (and others) are included, but not with just `status`.
    * **Schema Cache Resets:** Performed `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';` SQL commands, visited Publications/Extensions pages, and executed **full Supabase Project Restarts**.
    * **Debug Functions:** Attempted to deploy a `debug-schema` Edge Function, but it failed to query `information_schema.columns`, so direct schema inspection from the function was not possible.
    * **UUID Issue is RESOLVED:** This is confirmed `crypto.randomUUID()` works.
    * **CORS Issue is RESOLVED:** Proxy and CORS-disabled browser work.

### 5.2 Remaining Unresolved Cosmetic Issue

* **Problem:** The "Framework Insight" box in the `AnalysisProgress.jsx` component **still lacks its full brand-aligned backgrounds and non-left borders**.
* **Status:** **UNRESOLVED - COSMETIC BUG (PARKED).**
* **Root Cause Suspected:** A deeply rooted CSS rendering issue, highly specific to the user's macOS environment's interaction with Vite's dev server and the Tailwind CDN, which has defied all standard application methods (classes, inline styles with vars/hex, `!important`, embedded `<style>`).
* **Workaround:** Functionality testing proceeds despite the cosmetic issue.

## 6. Resolved Issues & Their Root Causes/Resolutions

All the following issues have been **successfully resolved**, but their history and solutions are critical context for future debugging:

* **Local Project on Cloud Drive:**
    * **Problem:** Project on Google Drive interfering with `npm`/`git` operations.
    * **Root Cause:** File locking, permissions, and path resolution conflicts from active cloud synchronization.
    * **Resolution:** Project folder was safely moved to a **truly local, unsynced directory** (`~/DevProjects/`).
    * **Lesson:** **NEVER** develop directly within a cloud-synced folder for Node.js/Git projects.

* **Supabase CLI Installation:**
    * **Problem:** Repeated failures with `npm -g`, `brew`, and `curl` scripts.
    * **Root Cause:** Environment `PATH` issues, `zsh` quirks, `npm -g` being unsupported, and unstable `curl` install script URLs.
    * **Resolution:** CLI installed via a **specific, manual `curl -LO` download of `supabase_linux_amd64.tar.gz` (version `1.171.2`) and `sudo mv` to `/usr/local/bin`**.
    * **Lesson:** For CLI installation issues, resort to manual binary download/placement.

* **`supabase init` "not a directory" error:**
    * **Problem:** `supabase init` failed because a conflicting `supabase` executable *file* existed.
    * **Root Cause:** A misplaced CLI binary from a previous installation attempt blocking directory creation.
    * **Resolution:** Conflicting file removed (`rm supabase`) before successful `supabase init`.

* **Git `push` failed due to divergent branches:**
    * **Problem:** Local `main` branch was behind remote, preventing `git push`.
    * **Root Cause:** Git history divergence (e.g., from Codespaces pushing an update, or a previous `git init` overriding local `.git`).
    * **Resolution:** Pulled with `git pull origin main --no-rebase` to explicitly merge, followed by `git push origin main`.
    * **Lesson:** Explicitly merge divergent branches (`git pull --no-rebase`) before pushing.

* **Edge Function `uuid` Module Import/Usage (`v4 is not a function`):**
    * **Problem:** Persistent `TypeError` when calling `uuid` generation.
    * **Root Cause:** Highly persistent and specific Deno module resolution issues for `deno.land/std/uuid` and its `v4` export.
    * **Resolution:** Bypassed the problematic `uuid` module entirely by using Deno's built-in **`crypto.randomUUID()`** for UUID generation in the Edge Function.
    * **Lesson:** Use Deno built-ins for core tasks like UUID generation if external modules prove unstable.

* **Problem:** CORS Policy Blocking Edge Function Call.
    * **Root Cause:** Browser security policy blocking cross-origin `OPTIONS` requests from `localhost` to Edge Function.
    * **Resolution:** Implemented **comprehensive CORS handling** in the Edge Function (`index.ts`) AND configured a **Vite proxy** in `vite.config.js` AND, crucially, relied on a **CORS-disabled Chrome instance** for local development testing as the ultimate bypass.
    * **Lesson:** For intractable CORS in development, a CORS-disabled browser is the most reliable workaround.

* **Problem:** User accounts not persisting in `public.users` table after magic link login.
    * **Root Cause:** Supabase's "Enable email confirm" setting was ON, requiring an extra, unhandled confirmation step.
    * **Resolution:** "Enable email confirm" was set to **OFF** in Supabase Auth Providers > Email settings.
    * **Lesson:** Authentication settings, especially email confirmation, must be precisely configured.

## 7. Remaining Work for MVP

The following tasks remain to complete the AImpactScanner MVP:

### 7.1 Phase 1: Infrastructure & Real-time Foundation (Completion)

* **CURRENT FOCUS: Resolve Persistent `PGRST204` Error on Final `analyses` Table Update.** This is the immediate functional blocker. (See Section 5.1 for details).
    * **Proposed Plan:** This requires a new approach to identify why specific columns are not recognized by PostgREST despite schema confirmation and aggressive cache resets.

### 7.2 Phase 2: Analysis Engine & Sophisticated Scoring (Starts after 7.1)

* **Integrate Actual Puppeteer Logic:** Replace simulated data extraction in `analyze-page` Edge Function with real Puppeteer web scraping. This is a complex step, requiring careful Deno/Puppeteer configuration for serverless environments.
* **Develop Full 22-Factor Assessment Logic:** Implement the complete assessment for each factor based on the fetched page data, including assigning scores and confidence indicators.
* **Implement Advanced Scoring Algorithms:** Develop multi-dimensional scoring logic for `aiSearch`, `agentCompatibility`, and `overall` scores.
* **Generate Real Quick Wins & Educational Content:** Based on factor results, generate prioritized recommendations and select relevant `educational_content`.
* **Performance Optimization (Initial):** Optimize Edge Function for 30-45 second analysis target.

### 7.3 Phase 3: Advanced UX & Business Integration

* **Interactive Results Presentation:** Implement interactive score cards, expandable factor sections, and visual confidence indicators on the frontend.
* **PDF Report Generation:** Implement customizable PDF reports with AI Search Mastery branding and sharing options.
* **Freemium Subscription Model:** Integrate Stripe for subscription management and usage enforcement (daily analysis limits).
* **Educational Content System:** Develop full contextual tooltip and progressive disclosure system on the frontend.

### 7.4 Phase 4: Optimization & Production Launch

* Comprehensive performance, error handling, and security optimizations.
* Production deployment and monitoring.
* User testing and feedback integration.

## 8. Agent Communication Protocols

Clara will maintain the ADHD-optimized communication protocol:
* **Quick Context & Daily Goal:** (1-2 sentences)
* **Technical Prerequisite Check:**
* **Exact Step-by-Step Instructions:** (Numbered, concise actions; **COMPLETE, copy-paste-ready code blocks**)
* **Confirmation/Validation Steps:** (Specific checks)
* **Error Handling Guidance:** (Tailored to specific command/action, including known workarounds).
* **Next Step Preview:** (Brief overview)
* **Proceed Confirmation:** (Ask for completion and any issues).

**Crucial Note for Next Agent:** The user explicitly prefers **minimal narrative and very specific, direct instructions**, especially when it comes to code. Provide full code blocks for files to be replaced. Be highly responsive to their feedback and adjust granularity immediately.
