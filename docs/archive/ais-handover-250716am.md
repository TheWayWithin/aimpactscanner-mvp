## 🔧 Critical Lessons Learned

### 1. Database Schema Management
**Issue**: Missing columns caused Edge Function failures
**Solution**: Always verify schema before deployment
**Command**: 
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'table_name';
```
**Prevention**: Use schema validation functions in CI/CD

### 2. RLS Policy Conflicts
**Issue**: Service role couldn't update user tables due to auth.uid() restrictions
**Solution**: Add service role policies with `current_setting('role') = 'service_role'`
**Location**: `supabase/migrations/003_service_role_policies.sql`
**Prevention**: Test service role permissions during development

### 3. Edge Function Timeout Reality
**Issue**: 60-second timeout too tight for 25-factor analysis
**Solution**: Two-phase architecture with instant + background processing
**Insight**: MVP should prioritize user experience over feature completeness
**Architecture**: Phase A (instant) + Phase B (background queue)

### 4. Real-time Progress Importance
**Issue**: Users abandon analysis without feedback
**Solution**: Comprehensive progress tracking with educational content
**Implementation**: Supabase subscriptions with progress_percent, stage, message fields
**Impact**: Dramatically improved user engagement

### 5. Circuit Breaker Pattern Necessity
**Issue**: Single factor failure could crash entire analysis
**Solution**: Implement circuit breakers for each factor
**Pattern**: Timeout → Fallback → Confidence scoring
**Result**: Improved reliability and user experience
