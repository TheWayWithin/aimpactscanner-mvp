## 🚨 **Critical Issues Discovered During Testing**

### **Critical Business Logic Issues** 
#### **Issue #1: Analysis Results Static** 🔴 **CRITICAL - REVENUE BLOCKING**
- **Problem**: All websites return identical score (67) regardless of actual quality
- **Impact**: Core value proposition broken - analysis shows no differentiation
- **Root Cause**: Analysis engine fetches real content but scoring algorithms lack variation
- **Location**: `supabase/functions/analyze-page/index.ts` - scoring functions
- **Status**: **IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED FOR REVENUE GENERATION**

#### **Issue #2: Payment System Mock Mode** 🔴 **CRITICAL - REVENUE BLOCKING**
- **Problem**: Development mode condition forces mock upgrades instead of real Stripe
- **Impact**: "Buy me a coffee" button errors, no actual payment processing possible
- **Root Cause**: `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` condition in UpgradeHandler.jsx:104,121
- **Location**: `src/components/UpgradeHandler.jsx` lines 104, 121
- **Status**: **IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED FOR REVENUE GENERATION**

#### **Issue #3: Missing Live Stripe Configuration** 🔴 **CRITICAL - REVENUE BLOCKING**
- **Problem**: Environment variables contain placeholder test values
- **Impact**: Even with mock mode disabled, no live payment processing capability
- **Solution**: Deploy live Stripe keys and update environment variables
- **Status**: **DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED AFTER FIXES**

### **Resolved Issues** ✅ **MAJOR BLOCKERS CLEARED**
The platform has overcome significant technical challenges from July 2025 development:

#### **Database Schema Issues** ✅ **RESOLVED**
