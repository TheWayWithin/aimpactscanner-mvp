## 🛠 Technical Architecture: Real-Time System

### Frontend Components

#### **AnalysisProgress.jsx** (Enhanced)
```javascript
// Key Features:
- Separate INSERT/UPDATE event handlers for Supabase subscriptions
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Fallback mechanism to check existing progress on mount
- Enhanced subscription configuration with broadcast and presence
- Graceful error handling with reconnection attempts
```

#### **App.jsx** (Optimized)
```javascript
// Key Changes:
- Immediate navigation: setCurrentView('analysis') before Edge Function call
- Non-blocking Edge Function: Using .then() instead of await
- Error handling: Comprehensive try/catch with user feedback
- State management: Proper analysisId and URL tracking
```

### Backend Implementation

#### **Edge Function** (supabase/functions/analyze-page/index.ts)
```typescript
// Enhanced Features:
- Progress callbacks with detailed educational content
- Version tracking for deployment verification
- 1-second delays between factors for visible progress
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Proper progress sequence: 5% → 95% → 100%
```

#### **AnalysisEngine.ts** (Real-Time Ready)
```typescript
// Key Implementation:
- updateProgress helper function with factor-specific content
- Educational content for all 10 factors
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Circuit breaker pattern for reliability
```

### Database Schema

#### **analysis_progress Table**
```sql
- analysis_id: UUID (FK to analyses)
- stage: TEXT (factor identification)
- progress_percent: INTEGER (0-100)
- message: TEXT (user-friendly progress message)
- educational_content: TEXT (factor-specific tips)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP (for ordering)
```

## 🎯 Next Development Priorities

### 1. **Results Dashboard Enhancement** (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)
```
Current Status: Basic ResultsDashboard.jsx exists
Next Step: Comprehensive results display with:
- Professional factor cards with scores, evidence, recommendations
- Pillar-based organization (AI: 5, Authority: 2, Machine: 1, Semantic: 2)
- Visual score indicators and progress bars
- Brand-consistent styling with AI Search Mastery design system
Estimated Time: 2 hours
```

### 2. **Factor Analysis Expansion**
```
Current Status: 10-factor Phase A analysis working
Next Step: Implement remaining factors for complete analysis
- Add Phase B factors (12 additional factors)
- Queue-based background processing
- Enhanced scoring algorithms
- Circuit breaker patterns for reliability
```

### 3. **Testing Framework Completion**
```
