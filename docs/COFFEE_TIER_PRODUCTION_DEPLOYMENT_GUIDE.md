## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

### **Phase 1: Stripe Configuration (30 minutes)**

#### **1.1 Create Stripe Products**
```bash
# Log into Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/products

# Create Products:
1. Product Name: "AImpactScanner Coffee Tier"
   - Description: "Unlimited Phase A AI optimization analysis"
   - Pricing: $5.00 USD monthly recurring
   - Copy the Price ID (e.g., price_1AbCdEf...)

2. Product Name: "AImpactScanner Professional" (for future)
   - Description: "Complete 22-factor AI optimization analysis"
   - Pricing: $29.00 USD monthly recurring
   - Copy the Price ID
```

#### **1.2 Configure Stripe Environment Variables**
```bash
# In your .env.local file, add:
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_..."
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_..."
VITE_STRIPE_COFFEE_PRICE_ID="price_1..."
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."

# In Supabase Dashboard -> Settings -> Environment Variables:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_..."
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
```

#### **1.3 Set Up Webhook Endpoints**
```bash
# In Stripe Dashboard -> Webhooks -> Add endpoint:
URL: https://[your-project-id].supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
Events: 
  - checkout.session.completed
  - invoice.payment_succeeded
  - customer.subscription.updated
  - customer.subscription.deleted
  - invoice.payment_failed
```

### **Phase 2: Supabase Production Setup (15 minutes)**

#### **2.1 Verify Database Migration**
```bash
# Run verification script:
npm run verify:migration

# Expected output: 5/6 or 6/6 checks passed
# If not all passed, run step-by-step verification:
npm run verify:steps
```

#### **2.2 Deploy Edge Functions**
```bash
# Deploy all Coffee tier functions:
npx supabase functions deploy analyze-page
npx supabase functions deploy create-checkout-session
npx supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook

# Verify deployment in Supabase Dashboard -> Edge Functions
```

#### **2.3 Test Database Functions**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, test core functions:
SELECT * FROM check_tier_access('test-user-uuid');
-- Should return tier access information

SELECT increment_monthly_analyses('test-user-uuid');
-- Should return usage count
```

### **Phase 3: Frontend Integration (20 minutes)**

#### **3.1 Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Update production environment variables:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_..."
VITE_STRIPE_COFFEE_PRICE_ID="price_..."
```

#### **3.2 Integrate Coffee Tier Components**
```jsx
// In your main App.jsx, integrate:
import TierSelection from './components/TierSelection'
import UsageDashboard from './components/UsageDashboard'
import { useUpgrade } from './components/UpgradeHandler'

// Example integration:
function App() {
  const { handleUpgrade, loading } = useUpgrade(
    user,
    (message) => setSuccessMessage(message),
    (error) => setErrorMessage(error)
  )

  return (
    <div>
      <UsageDashboard user={user} onUpgrade={handleUpgrade} />
      <TierSelection currentTier={user?.tier} onUpgrade={handleUpgrade} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### **3.3 Build and Deploy Frontend**
```bash
# Build for production:
npm run build

# Deploy to your hosting platform:
# - Vercel: vercel --prod
# - Netlify: netlify deploy --prod
# - Custom: Upload dist/ folder
```

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation (15 minutes)**

#### **4.1 End-to-End Payment Flow**
```bash
# Test complete payment flow:
1. Sign up new user account
2. Attempt analysis (should hit free tier limit after 3)
3. Click "Upgrade to Coffee Tier"
4. Complete Stripe checkout with test card
5. Verify unlimited access granted
6. Test usage analytics recording
```

#### **4.2 Stripe Test Cards**
```bash
# Use Stripe test cards:
Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242 (any CVC, future date)
Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002
```

#### **4.3 Monitor Webhooks**
```bash
# In Stripe Dashboard -> Webhooks -> [your endpoint]
# Verify events are being received and processed
# Check Supabase Edge Function logs for webhook processing
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### **Key Metrics to Track**

#### **Revenue Metrics**
```sql
-- Monthly recurring revenue
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
  tier,
  COUNT(*) as subscriptions,
  COUNT(*) * (CASE tier WHEN 'coffee' THEN 5 WHEN 'professional' THEN 29 ELSE 0 END) as mrr
FROM subscriptions 
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY month, tier
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

#### **Usage Analytics**
```sql
-- Daily analysis usage by tier
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as day,
  tier,
  COUNT(*) as analyses,
  AVG(processing_time_ms) as avg_processing_time
FROM usage_analytics
GROUP BY day, tier
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

#### **Conversion Tracking**
```sql
-- Free to Coffee tier conversion rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN tier = 'free' THEN 1 END) as free_users,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN tier = 'coffee' THEN 1 END) as coffee_users,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(CASE WHEN tier = 'coffee' THEN 1 END)::float / 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN tier = 'free' THEN 1 END)::float * 100, 2
  ) as conversion_rate_percent
FROM users;
```

### **Supabase Dashboard Monitoring**
```bash
# Monitor these sections regularly:
1. Edge Functions -> Logs (check for errors)
2. Database -> RLS (verify policies working)
3. API -> Usage (track request volume)
4. Storage -> Bandwidth (monitor costs)
```

### **Stripe Dashboard Monitoring**
```bash
# Key areas to monitor:
1. Revenue -> MRR growth
2. Subscriptions -> Churn rate
3. Webhooks -> Success rate (should be >99%)
4. Disputes -> Handle proactively
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Payment Issues**
```bash
Problem: Stripe checkout not working
Solution: 
1. Verify VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY is correct
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Ensure Stripe Price ID matches product configuration
4. Test with Stripe test mode first
```

#### **Tier Access Issues**
```bash
Problem: Users not getting unlimited access after payment
Solution:
1. Check webhook is being called (Stripe Dashboard)
2. Verify webhook processing in Supabase Function logs
3. Confirm user record updated: SELECT tier FROM users WHERE id = 'user-id'
4. Test tier validation: SELECT * FROM check_tier_access('user-id')
```

#### **Database Issues**
```bash
Problem: Database functions not found
Solution:
1. Re-run migration: Apply COFFEE_TIER_MIGRATION_STEP_BY_STEP.sql
2. Verify permissions: GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION ... TO authenticated
3. Check RLS policies are not blocking access
```

### **Edge Function Debugging**
```bash
# Enable detailed logging:
1. In Supabase Dashboard -> Edge Functions -> analyze-page -> Logs
2. Look for tier validation logs: "🔍 Tier access check"
3. Check for TierManager fallback messages
4. Verify database connection and query execution
```
